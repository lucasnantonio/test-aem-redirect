This website used to be built using Hugo and served on Github pages, at the url `twitter.github.io/communitynotes`.

We've since moved it to another hosting service, and the site lives on `communitynotes.twitter.com/guide`

The files on this folder simply redirect visitors to the new corresponding page on the new domain.
